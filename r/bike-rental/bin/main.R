### Your Challenge ###
#
# Your challenge will be to conduct a time series data analysis 
# to forecast future rental bike demands. To do this, you will load, 
# clean, process, analyze, and visualize data. 
# You will also pose questions, and seek to answer them meaningfully using 
# the dataset provided. In addition, you will build time series models to 
# forecast future demands.
#
# In this project, we'll use a data set containing the hourly and daily count 
# of rental bikes from year 2025 in the Capital bike share 
# system in Washington, DC, with the corresponding weather and seasonal 
# information.
#
# After you perform your analysis, you will share your findings.
